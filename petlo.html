         <p class="page"> Petlo, a pet adoption app that myself and our team of 4 designed for a 24-hour designathon held at <b> IIIT-D </b> in New Delhi, India. It is an app which aims to make the process of pet adoption easier. Our team emerged in the <b> Top 3 </b> for the competition. This was my first competition designing User Interface, and I was satisfied with the result and how much I learnt in just a day. </p>
         <p class="page"> In today’s mundane world, people lose out on time for themselves, let alone their pets. This leads to the poor animals being abandoned, scheduled for adoptions (which will most likely never happen) in shelter homes, or worse yet, left to fend for themselves on the streets. </p>
         <p class="page"> At the same time, it is also a fact that more and more people are getting sensitized towards the ideas of keeping pets, especially with the advent of the millennials, for the number of pomerians in a common Delhi locality have increased monumentally, and we all are witness to it.</p>
         <p class="page"> So, 
            How do we connect these poor animals and loving adopters? 
         </p>
         <p class="page"> 
            A phone call to your nearest NGO/vet?
            Hmm, maybe. 
         </p>
         <p class="page"> 
            Visiting shelter homes in person and choose only one little bunny amongst a hundred cute rabbits? 
         </p>
         <p class="page"> Could work, but quite impossible. </p>
         <p class="page">
            Or how about an app? 
         </p>
         <p class="page">
            An app which connects you to earnest adopters closeby, who have the resources to give your pet a second home, be it temporary or permanent.
            An app which connects pets with the love and care they not want, but deserve.
            An app which is in itself a mini-world of anything your pet might need or desire.
            Thus, came forward ‘Petlo’.
